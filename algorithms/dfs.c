Average Case:O(V+E)here V means vertices and E means edges
Worst case:O(V+E)here V means vertices and E means edges

/*
Working of the linear search
->it is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph ata structures.The algorithm starts at the nodes and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking
