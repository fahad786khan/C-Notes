/*Graph Algorithms are a set of instructions used to solve problems related to graph theory,where data is represented as a collection of nodes connected by edges,like trees
 */
/*Time Complexity
Breadth-First Search
Best Case:O(V)
Average Case:O(V+E)here V means vertices and E means edges
Worst case:O(V+E)
 */
//?Space complexity :O(|V|)

/*
Working of the linear search
->it is a layer-by-layer approach,casting a wide net from your starting point and graduaily widening it
